What is Abstract class?(there is no body for the parent class)
We know in Java there is no allowance for multiple inheritance so he should somehow Abstarction (OOPS) in Java in order to use it there are 2 ways 1. to use abstract class and another to use 2. interfaces in Java.
Abstract classes is not like a regular classes where  the parent class only have the body and functions that need to be  overrided by their children classes 


* WE CANNOT CREATE OBJECT OF THE ABSTRACT CLASS
* NO ABSTRACT CONSTRUCTORS ,NO STATIC METHOUDS

For the children class:
There are two ways to use abstract classes in children 
 1. to declare the child as an abstract class
 2. another way is to over write the method that has been done in the the parent class(use extend keyword).
